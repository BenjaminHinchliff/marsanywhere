  abstract = {The NASA Mars 2020 rover mission will explore an astrobiologically
              relevant martian site to investigate regional geology, evaluate
              past habitability, seek signs of ancient life, and assemble a
              returnable cache of samples. The spacecraft is based on successful
              heritage design of the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover, but
              includes a new scientific payload and other advanced capabilities.
              The Mars 2020 science payload features the first two Raman
              spectrometers on Mars, the first microfocus X-ray fluorescence
              instrument, the first ground-penetrating radar, an infrared
              spectrometer, an upgraded microscopic and stereo context cameras
              and weather station, and a demonstration unit for oxygen production
              on Mars. The instrument suite combines visible and multispectral
              imaging with coordinated measurements of chemistry and mineralogy,
              from the submillimeter to the regional scale. Using the data
              acquired by the science instruments as a guide, the team will
              collect core samples of rock and regolith selected to represent the
              geologic diversity of the landing site and maximize the potential
              for future Earth-based analyses to answer fundamental questions in
              astrobiology and planetary science. These samples will be drilled,
              hermetically sealed, and cached on the martian surface for possible
              retrieval and return to Earth by future missions. The Mars 2020
              spacecraft is designed and built according to an unprecedented set
              of biological, organic, and inorganic cleanliness requirements to
              maximize the scientific value of this sample suite. Here, we
              present the scientific vision for the Mars 2020 mission, provide an
              overview of the analytic capabilities of the science payload, and
              discuss how Mars 2020 seeks to further our understanding of
              habitability, biosignatures, and possibility of life beyond Earth.},

  abstract = {The HiRISE camera features a 0.5 m diameter primary mirror, 12 m
              effective focal length, and a focal plane system that can acquire
              images containing up to 28 Gb (gigabits) of data in as little as 6
              seconds. HiRISE will provide detailed images (0.25 to 1.3 m/pixel)
              covering ∼1\% of the Martian surface during the 2-year Primary
              Science Phase (PSP) beginning November 2006. Most images will
              include color data covering 20\% of the potential field of view. A
              top priority is to acquire ∼1000 stereo pairs and apply precision
              geometric corrections to enable topographic measurements to better
              than 25 cm vertical precision. We expect to return more than 12 Tb
              of HiRISE data during the 2-year PSP, and use pixel binning,
              conversion from 14 to 8 bit values, and a lossless compression
              system to increase coverage. HiRISE images are acquired via 14 CCD
              detectors, each with 2 output channels, and with multiple choices
              for pixel binning and number of Time Delay and Integration lines.
              HiRISE will support Mars exploration by locating and characterizing
              past, present, and future landing sites, unsuccessful landing sites
              , and past and potentially future rover traverses. We will
              investigate cratering, volcanism, tectonism, hydrology, sedimentary
              processes, stratigraphy, aeolian processes, mass wasting, landscape
              evolution, seasonal processes, climate change, spectrophotometry,
              glacial and periglacial processes, polar geology, and regolith
              properties. An Internet Web site (HiWeb) will enable anyone in the
              world to suggest HiRISE targets on Mars and to easily locate, view,
              and download HiRISE data products.},
