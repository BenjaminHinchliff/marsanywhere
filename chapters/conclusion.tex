\chapter{Conclusion}

We present MarsAnywhere, a dataset and pipeline for aerial to ground
360\degree{} panorama synthesis for mars imagery. We utilize mosaic panorama
data from the Perseverance rover along with its associated satellite imagery and
DEM data to build a dataset based on a ground view projected prior. We then
build a ControlNet based pipeline on Stable Diffusion 2.1 to synthesize the
ground imagery.

Our contributions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We create a dataset for aerial-to-ground synthesis for mars imagery,
    suitable for our work and as the basis for future work.
    \item We create a pipeline to reconstruct 360\degree{} panoramas of ground
    imagery from a satellite image and associated DEM data.
    \item We evaluate our pipeline on a wide variety of metrics against a simple
    mean baseline.
\end{itemize}

MarsAnywhere is provides a dataset and is a step towards ground view synthesis
anywhere on mars from just satellite imagery.
