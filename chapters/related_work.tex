\section{Aerial Ground Co-location/Geolocation}

A closely related field of research is that of cross view geo-localization,
specifically, aerial ground co-location, which consists of localizing ground
imagery based on corresponding aerial imagery. This has extensive application
varying from self-driving cars to robotics.

The state of the art consists of many different approaches varying from
traditional feature matching techniques \cite{castaldo2015featurematching} to
ground to aerial synthesis with feature matching \cite{regmi2019g2amatching}.

Notable to this work, similar techniques have also been applied on mars with the
roll out of Global Localization techniques for Perseverance rover operation,
utilizing the aerial view projected orthomoasics and template matching
\cite{verma2024globalloco}.

\section{Satellite-to-street View Synthesis}

Satellite to street view synthesis for Earth imagery is a well-studied problem,
with a focus on applications to urban areas, as these tend to be the most
difficult. With sufficiently large dataset, direct image to image translation
can produce decent results, however on earth the additional complexity of the
imagery can create a number of issues. For example, if the model lacks an
understanding of the different types of structures in the imagery, it can
misidentify them and then subsequently mispredict them in the imagery. For
example, misunderstanding a helipad as a road or the like. To help mitigate
these issues, it's common to introduce additional semantic information to
attempt to categorize the different types of terrain, such as grass, road,
trees, which helps improve model performance \cite{zhai2017groundlayout, tang2019selectiongan}.

Another common avenue of research is to focus on various reprojection techniques, such as projecting to a birds eye view \cite{ye2025bev}, or polar
transformation \cite{toker2021dte}. Another notable example is differentiable reprojection techniques such as in the work of \citeauthor{shi2022geopanoramasynth} where a learnable reprojection module is used to relate the satellite and ground views \cite{shi2022geopanoramasynth}.
