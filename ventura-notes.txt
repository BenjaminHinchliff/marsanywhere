Questions from Austin:
why not use more satellite / DEM imagery to create the ground view in Blender?
adding time-of-day information
would be nice to have any kind of baseline comparison (other than the mean)

Questions from Fahim:
~~How could rover masking be done? What would be used to replace the missing pixels?~~
What are the potential applications?

Questions/notes from me:
Re: masking — you can downscale the mask to the size of the latents to mask the loss during training on latent space
What does “mean baseline” image look like?
!! Would be nice to see conditioning image in the results too
!!Would be good to see multiple generations for each example.
!!How many images are the dataset? how many could we possibly obtain? (mentioned that it is 1000 but I'm not sure this is listed in the thesis document itself)
What other strategies could be good other than ControlNet?Questions from the audience:
What was difficult / time-consuming?
What would be better metrics to use? something task-specific? what are the envisioned applications?
What’s the resolution of the satellite imagery? what can you see in the satellite imagery?
What would be the most promising direction for future work?

Some notes on the thesis:
thesis notes:

- [X] Correct Fahim's name in list
- [X] Correct my name in acknowledgments (thanks for your kind note there)
- [X] (WIP) in general need to run spell check
- [X] Page 4: liine -> line
- [X] Page 5 and everywhere: sattelite -> satellite
- [X] Page 5: why not use h for height and w for width?
- [X] Page 7 and elsewhere Mars is not capitalized — is that on purpose?
- [X] Global Localization shouldn’t be captialized on page 7.
- [X] roll out -> rollout
- [X] Cylnidrical projection equations (2.1 and 2.2) look a bit strange. Do you have a reference for it? Why are we multipling theta by 2pi ? Shouldn’t we divide by 2pi instead of multiply? See my attached PDF.
- [X] Page 8 Shi, Campbell, Yu, and Li -> Shi et al.
- [X] Figure 3.1 controlnet -> ControlNet
- [X] Chapter 3 this is pretty brief and it is not clear about how the related
work connects to your work. Would be nice to have the figures as you showed in
the presentation. How did the literature search inform your design choices? Why
did you choose to use SD + ControlNet and not something else?
- [X] Equations 4.1 and 4.2 — these were confusing. What are R and S? You are basically stretching the image horizontally and vertically — it doesn’t seem to be the appropriate transformation. Could you explain more how you derived this? Where to theta min/max and phi min/max come from?
dem -> DEM
- [ ] Section 4.3 “preliminary testing” -> do you have these results?  Can you show them?
Do figures 4.2 and 4.3 show the same area? are they supposed to correspond?
Figure 4.5 is the only place where we see a prior image and a ground image
side-by-side. It would be nice to have a lot more examples of this and larger so
that we can really see how good the correspondence is. Since the location is not
precise, it seems that perhaps the prior image does not correspond well to the
ground image? This presumably will hinder the model from learning to accurately
produce the ground image from the prior image?
- [X?] Page 26 missing reference
- [X] Section 5.4 “inelegant splitting” this issue has been resolved?
- [X] Perseverance -> Perserverance
- [ ] Section 5.5 why is the second limitation considered more minor? This
limitation wasn’t clearly described and I think it could use more discussion

- [-] I think overall you could use more discussion of limitations. Were the
super-saturated colors discussed anywhere? Did you try to resolve that by
clipping to 0-1?
- [ ] You should expand future work as mentioned above and include discussion of
making a more complete ground image (edited)
